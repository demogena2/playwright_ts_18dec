## Day1 
This is the first day of the Playwright with TypeScript project.
1. npm init -y // to setup package.json 
2. npm init playwright@latest // to setup playwright
3. npx playwright install // to install browsers
4. npm install typescript --save-dev // to install typescript
4. npx tsc --init // to setup tsconfig.json

# js cocnepts used
- object destructuring
- async await

# playwright concepts used
- locators
- assertions
- autowaiting --- without using await it will not work // so always use await with playwright functions
